// Question 42: Great Magicians
// Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
// Great Magicians

function show_magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (let magician of magicians) {
        console.log(magician);
    }
}

function make_great(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (let i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = magicians[i] + ' the Great';
    }
}

const magicians = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Dynamo', 'Penn Jillette'];
make_great(magicians);
show_magicians(magicians);
