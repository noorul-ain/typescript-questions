// 12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
const names: string[] = ["Ali", "Sara", "John", "Ayesha"];
names.forEach((name: string) => console.log(`Hello ${name}, hope you are doing well!`));
